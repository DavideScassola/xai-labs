    "This is a cox proportional hazards model on data from <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nhanes1\">NHANES I</a> with followup mortality data from the <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nhefs\">NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study</a>. It is designed to illustrate how SHAP values enable the interpretion of XGBoost models with a clarity traditionally only provided by linear models. We see interesting and non-linear patterns in the data, which suggest the potential of this approach. Keep in mind the data has not yet been checked by us for calibrations to current lab tests and so you should not consider the results as actionable medical insights, but rather a proof of concept. "
